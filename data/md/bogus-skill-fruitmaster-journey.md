**Story Overview**

In this world, individuals gain special abilities by consuming "Skill Fruits," but each person can eat only one; consuming a second results in death. The protagonist, Light, dreams of becoming an adventurer but acquires the seemingly useless "Fruitmaster" skill, which only allows him to cultivate fruits, leading him to a life as a farmer. However, by chance, he consumes another Skill Fruit and survives, discovering that his skill enables him to eat multiple Skill Fruits without fatal consequences, thereby acquiring numerous abilities. This revelation propels Light on a journey from farmer to top adventurer. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
