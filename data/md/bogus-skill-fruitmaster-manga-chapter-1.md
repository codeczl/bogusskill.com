## Chapter 1 Plot Overview

The story takes place in a world where people consume special fruits to gain skills. However, there’s a catch—if you consume more than one fruit, it’s fatal. Light, the protagonist, is desperate to acquire a combat skill but ends up with the skill *Fruitmaster*, which allows him to grow fruits more effectively. Meanwhile, his childhood friend Lena receives the rare and powerful skill *Sword Saint* and is forced by the church to become an adventurer.

Although Lena rises quickly to S-rank, Light reluctantly settles for running a farm, growing skill fruits for the church. Living with Light is Ayla, an orphan, who unknowingly uses the skill fruits to cook. Later, Light survives an attempt to consume a second fruit and is shocked to discover that he has gained the skill *Sword God*, allowing him to defend himself more effectively.

A holy revelation follows, warning of an evil presence, and Ayla acquires the *Appraisal* skill, realizing that *Fruitmaster* makes Light immune to poisonous fruits. With this newfound power, Light excitedly registers as an adventurer. However, things take a turn when an adventurer named Gene attempts to bully him, only for Light to skillfully defend himself. Later, Gene and his team encounter an ogre, and Light kills it, proving his growing strength. Just when things seem to be going smoothly, Light meets someone who claims not to be Lena, leaving him confused and searching for answers.
